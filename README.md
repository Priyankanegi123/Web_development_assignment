Q1. Write a JavaScript program to change the characters (lower case) in a string where a turns into z, b turns into y, c turns into x, ..., n turns into m, m turns into n, ..., z turns into a. 

Q2. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a point lies strictly inside a given circle.
Input: 
Center of the circle (x, y)
Radius of circle: r
Point inside a circle (a, b)

Q3. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given matrix is an identity matrix.
Note: In linear algebra, the identity matrix, or sometimes ambiguously called a unit matrix, of size n is the n ? n square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]] -> true
[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]] -> false

Q4. Write a JavaScript program to find all the possible options to replace the hash in a string (Consists of digits and one hash (#)) with a digit to produce an integer divisible by 3.
For a string "2*0", the output should be : ["210", "240", "270"]

Q5. Write a JavaScript function to convert a binary number to a decimal number.
Test Data :
console.log(bin_to_dec('110011'));
console.log(bin_to_dec('100'));

Q1. Write a JavaScript program to change the characters (lower case) in a string where a turns into z, b        turns into y, c turns into x, ..., n turns into m, m turns into n, ..., z turns into as

Q2. Write a JavaScript program to find all distinct prime factors of a given integer.

Q3. Write a JavaScript program to find the number of even digits in a given integer.

Q4. Write a JavaScript program to reverse the order of the bits in a given integer.
Sample Example:
56 -> 111000 after reverse 7 -> 111
234 -> 11101010 after reverse 87 -> 1010111

Q5. Write a JavaScript program to create the value of NOR of two given booleans.
Note: In boolean logic, logical nor or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is the negation of logical or. That is, a sentence of the form (p NOR q) is true precisely when neither p nor q is true - i.e. when both of p and q are false
Sample Example:
For x = true and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = false; For x = false and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = true.

 

                                                   Part C

 

Q1. Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string.
Example string : 'dog'
Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g

Q2. Write a JavaScript function to get the function name.

Q3.Write a JavaScript function to find longest substring in a given a string without repeating characters

Q4.Write a JavaScript function to apply Bubble Sort algorithm.
Sample array : [12, 345, 4, 546, 122, 84, 98, 64, 9, 1, 3223, 455, 23, 234, 213]
Expected output : [3223, 546, 455, 345, 234, 213, 122, 98, 84, 64, 23, 12, 9, 4, 1]

 Q5. Write a JavaScript function that generates a string id (specified length) of random characters.
Sample character list : "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
